    <h1>Welcome to CSSI....</h1>
        <p>You've just gotten out of CSSI for the
          day and are on your way to have dinner.
          As you're waiting at the corner, a self-driving car pulls up.</p>
        <p>The door opens...and no one is inside. What do you do?</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/run">Run away!</a>
          <li><a href="/enter">Jump in the car</a>
          <li><a href="/selfie">Take a selfie</a>
          <li><a href="/911">Call 911</a>
